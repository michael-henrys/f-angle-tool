      <h5>Introduction</h5>
      <p>
        The Rockfall Activity Rate System (RoARS) provides indication/forecasts of the magnitude of rock/debris that could fall from a slope – of a given height, angle, and area – at different levels of earthquake shaking. These forecasts are derived from an empirical relationship between the volumes of rock that fell from the selected Port Hills rock slopes during the 2010/11 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence (CES), New Zealand, in response to earthquake shaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        RoARS is underpinned by the assumption that if a slope is strongly shaken by an earthquake, the volume of debris that falls from it is a function of the magnitude of the shaking (e.g., Peak Ground Acceleration) and the geometry of the slope (e.g., slope, height, and area). The method and results are presented in Massey et al. (2022).
      </p>
      <h5>Overview method</h5>
      <p>
        The methodology described below is split into several steps. In summary, these are: Step 1) estimate the rockfall volumes that fell from a selected number of rock slopes during the CES; Step 2) estimate the earthqußake-induced ground motions for the main earthquakes in the CES at slopes of interest; Step 3) carry out a regional-scale statistical analysis of the factors influencing rockfall susceptibility – in this case the volume of debris that could fall from each slope – using the results from Steps 1) and 2).
      </p>
      <p>
        The data, results, and analyses relate to the ‘larger’ slopes in the Port Hills of Christchurch. These slopes all meet the criteria of being: (1) coastal or relict coastal in origin; (2) formed in rock; (3) greater than 10 m in vertical height (referring to the rock-dominated portion of the slope); (4) steeper than 45° (referring to the mean angle of the rock-dominated portion of the slope); and (5) greater than 50 m2 in surface area. Such slopes were found to be susceptible to failure during the CES. Slopes less than 10 m in height and/or flatter than 45° did not typically fail during the CES. Slopes less than 50 m2 in surface area were not included as they are too small and numerous for this analysis. Slopes modified by anthropogenic cutting were also not included unless they were originally abandoned coastal slopes and satisfied the aforementioned slope criteria.
