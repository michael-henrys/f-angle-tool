            The Fahrböschung (F-) angle is the angle between the crown of a landslide source and the toe of the landslide deposit. Back-analyses of the runout of over 1100 landslides of several different types have determined empirical relationships between the height of the slope and the volume of the landslide mass, from which the F-angle can be estimated (Brideau et al 2021). The scatter in the back-analysed data allows Probability of Exceedance thresholds to be established, that can be used as the probability of a landslide travelling past a location.
          </p>
          <p>
            This F-Angle tool calculates a Fahrböschung angle, that can be used, with further analysis, to estimate the runout distance for a certain type of landslide from a slope. The output(s) of the tool can be used to generate a first approximation of runout distance. The inputs required to estimate the F-Angle are 1) landslide type, 2) a volume estimate of the potential failure mass from the slope, and 3) a probability of the runout distance being exceeded. The tool should be used by landslide practitioners and researchers that have a good technical understanding of landslides.

        The data and model on which this Tool is based, and the creation of the tool, were prepared by the Institute of Geological &amp; Nuclear Sciences Limited (GNS Science) as part of a New Zealand Government funded research project (MBIE Endeavour - C05X1709). The information is derived from multiple data sources, including third party data, which are at various scales and resolutions. <s>The tool in this context is defined as the data, model and process that allows the user to forecast the volume of the material that might fall from a slope of given height, angle and area, at a given level of earthquake shaking. The algorithm (model) underpinning the tool is based on the one published in Massey et al., (2022).</s>

        As there is always uncertainty associated with the data used and the models developed from it, GNS Science gives no warranties of any kind concerning its assessment and estimates, including accuracy, completeness, timeliness or fitness for purpose, and accepts no responsibility for any actions taken based on or reliance placed on the forecasts by any person or organisation. GNS Science excludes to the full extent permitted by law any liability to any person or organisation for any loss, damage or expense, direct or indirect, and however caused, whether through negligence or otherwise, resulting from any person or organisation's use of or reliance on the Tool, the results from it and the data it is based on.

        As much of the analysis and assessment relies on inferences from slopes within a particular geology and physiographical setting that were shaken by a particular suite of earthquakes, the applicability of the tool to a specific slope(s) should be considered. It is recommended that on-site verification be carried out to assess whether the tool is applicable for use at a particular site of interest. The Tool is intended to be used by suitably qualified people (e.g., Professional engineering geologists and geotechnical engineers) as part of their regional-scale ‘desktop’ assessment. This Tool should not be used as a replacement or substitute for site- specific analyses and assessments.
